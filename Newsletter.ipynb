      "URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/crypto-and-fintech-cry-foul-over-debanking-could-real-issue-lie-in-risk/\n",
      "Content: FinTech and crypto investor Marc Andreessen kicked off a firestorm over the weekend by alleging, on Joe Rogan’s podcast, that those two sectors — and dozens of companies backed by his namesake firm, Andreessen Horowitz — were being fundamentally “debanked” by U.S. financial institutions (FIs). “Did you know that 30 tech founders were secretly debanked?” tweeted Elon Musk on X, linking to a clip of the podcast. The term “debanking” often refers to the practice of financial institutions, such as banks, closing or restricting access to accounts or refusing services to certain individuals, organizations or industries. This can occur for various reasons, including regulatory concerns, perceived risks, compliance issues or reputational considerations. For the past few days, Andreessen has continued retweeting alleged debanking stories from founders. Neither he nor his fund replied immediately to PYMNTS’ request for comment. But while the tech investor’s remarks may resonate with the frustrations of many in the cryptocurrency and FinTech sectors, the reality could be far more nuanced than a political assault on crypto and FinTech. After all, innovation typically moves faster than regulation, and the growing strain between traditional banks and future-fit FinTech and crypto firms can also be in part chalked up to the inevitable consequence of outdated regulatory frameworks, stricter know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards, as well as heightened fraud risks. Read more: Surging Business Innovation Puts Compliance Role at Center of Growth At the heart of the issue is potentially the lack of a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework to address the unique risks posed by the FinTech and cryptocurrency industries. Financial institutions, tasked with navigating a labyrinth of overlapping and often contradictory rules themselves, can commonly be left with little incentive to take on high-risk clients when the compliance burden could outweigh any potential gains. For example, news broke on Monday (Dec. 2) that the a16z-backed FinTech Revolut was facing a lawsuit tied into a wave of anti-fraud complaints. The case covered Monday is among thousands of complaints filed against U.K.-based Revolut relating to authorized push payment (APP) fraud, scams in which criminals dupe people into sending money online to an account beyond their control. Another a16z-backed FinTech, banking-as-a-service (BaaS) provider Synapse, collapsed in April, sending shockwaves throughout the sector and entangling four banks, American Bank, AMG National Trust, Evolve Bank and Trust and Lineage Bank, along with it. “The regulators are now awake,” Thredd CEO Jim McCarthy told PYMNTS in June. Within the crypto sector, specters of past failures like FTX and ongoing rates of fraud loom even larger. For banks whose risk teams may not have had systems in place to prevent criminal and downstream regulatory violations like those recklessly deployed by FTX, it can be easier to embrace a mindset where the innovation juice just isn’t worth the squeeze. The crypto landscape remains one where the fraud rate is high, and the tools to mitigate this fraud are expensive. Until that changes, banks could hold the view that the industry as more trouble than it’s worth. After all, traditional banks are highly incentivized to play it safe. The penalties for failing to identify illicit activity can be massive, not to mention the impact of the reputational damage. And the tightening of regulatory standards in the wake of high-profile financial scandals has created an environment where risk aversion is paramount. Read more: Payments Execs Say Banking-as-a-Service Players Forgot the Banking Part Debanking can create significant challenges for affected parties, especially if they rely on financial services to operate. For businesses, it might mean difficulty accessing payment systems, obtaining credit or even simply depositing funds. Critics argue that debanking can sometimes unfairly target legal industries or marginalized groups, raising concerns about financial inclusion and fairness. Without a coherent framework that provides clear guidelines for banks, FinTechs and crypto companies to manage KYC/AML risks, the current stalemate may be likely to persist. Bridging the divide could ultimately require more than soundbites and instead rest upon a systemic rethinking of how financial institutions, regulators and innovators can coexist in an increasingly complex financial landscape. PYMNTS covered Monday (Nov. 25) how cryptocurrencies, and more specifically their underlying blockchain technologies, have gone from a solution in search of a problem to a solution in hopes of some regulatory clarity. Of course, that clarity may come when cryptocurrency companies and other firms embrace and invest in, rather than resist, appropriate guardrails for their industries.\n",

      "URL: https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/103381/bectran-teams-with-giact-to-combat-ach-fraud\n",
      "Content: ACH remains a popular payment method for B2B finance operations. 0 27 November 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. At the same time, ACH is one of the most commonly and easily defrauded forms of payment. Victim organizations risk significant losses, compromised reputation and possible legal consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bectran, Inc., the credit, collections and accounts receivable platform leading the way in fraud prevention, has partnered with GIACT, part of the London Stock Exchange Group and the leader in helping companies positively identify and authenticate customers, to offer robust, persistent protection against ACH fraud for credit departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Partnering with GIACT marks a significant step in Bectran’s commitment to streamlining credit risk management,” comments Bectran’s CEO, Louis Ifeguni. “Identifying potential ACH fraud automatically and reliably gives departments a profound additional security in their decisioning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Know Your Business\n",
      "Many credit departments collect ACH forms on their credit applications. Requests backed by valid bank accounts should represent a lower risk, making decisioning quick and more confident. Without verification, though, unstable or stolen bank account information can easily pass as trustworthy — garnering quick approvals.\n",
      "\n",
      "While such ACH fraud has historically been associated mostly with consumer transactions, more and more scammers have begun targeting B2B credit, lured by the high-dollar transactions and relative ease of ACH forgery. Even departments that do verify ACH may still be vulnerable. Some services use outdated databases to check account funding and standing. Few services include the ability to match applicants to account owners, meaning applications could be approved based on stolen credentials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protect It Automatically\n",
      "With GIACT, Bectran provides users leading coverage for account verification and ACH fraud prevention. GIACT’s real-time account checks keep credit reviews and customer experience running smoothly. At the same time, as part of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), GIACT has access to the largest bank account database in the US, giving credit departments more confidence and security in their decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bectran utilizes GIACT to give creditors two layers of account validation. The first verifies each account’s status, indicating whether the account is open and whether it has any risk indicators such as recent returns or insufficient funds notices. The second attempts to authenticate the account, comparing the applicant information with the account owner’s information when available, which can help catch applicants using stolen bank account information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bectran combine these checks and presents them seamlessly in the credit workflow, aiding departments in protecting their businesses. Bectran automatically flags transactions indicated by GIACT as high-risk and provides a report of GIACT’s findings on each application. Backed by Bectran and GIACT, credit departments can more quickly and confidently identify safe accounts while assessing risky transactions with more reliable and complete information.\n",
      "\n",
      "“GIACT brings the trustworthiness of the London Stock Exchange Group to credit departments using ACH,” says Ali Kidwai, Product & Implementation Sr. Manager, Bectran. “You can move through credit reviews faster and more securely, trusting that bank accounts are verified thoroughly.”\n",

      "Content: As part of their collaboration, Creand Crèdit Andorrà is set to integrate a suite of NICE Actimize’s financial crime solutions into its operations to address global AML regulations more efficiently. The company’s holdings include financial institutions in Andorrà, Luxembourg, Spain, Panama, and the US. From NICE Actimize’s offerings, Creand Crèdit Andorrà selected its Suspicious Activity Monitoring (SAM), Customer Due Diligence (CDD-X) and Watchlist Screening (WL-X) solutions, which underline the company’s industry knowledge and continued investment, as well as its commitment to AML technology, including intelligence automation, network analytics, machine learning features, and an augmented case management component.  The agreement with Creand Crèdit Andorrà comes shortly after NICE Actimize partnered with TF Bank to improve the latter’s financial crime prevention programme via AML and SaaS services. The digital bank intended to utilise the suite of AI-driven AML services to scale customer protection. In addition, TF Bank aimed to leverage the NICE Actimize AML Essentials, a cloud-based offering of end-to-end AML services, to optimise its financial crime prevention programme. The Suspicious Activity Monitoring service focuses on ensuring the detection of potentially illicit transactions, leveraging machine learning algorithms to offer increased precision. NICE Actimize’s system intends to augment an institution’s ability to identify and manage risk, maintain the trust of customers and handle regulatory requirements. On the other hand, the CDD-X tool delivers a risk-based approach and optimises customer life cycle risk management with event-driven risk monitoring, utilising AI and machine learning. Creand Crèdit Andorrà also chose to integrate NICE Actimize’s WL-X screening solution, which uses the capabilities of AI for data management, advanced screening and customer onboarding. When commenting on the announcement, representatives from Creand Crèdit Andorrà underlined that NICE Actimize previously established the foundation for the institution's current AML and financial crime platform. The agreement now enables Creand Crèdit Andorrà to benefit from the company’s advanced portfolio of financial crime solutions. The move can be attributed to the environment in Andorrà, with the region attracting global investors, which requires an optimised approach for both evaluating customer onboarding and monitoring transactions. NICE Actimize is set to support Creand Crèdit Andorrà in adapting to the ongoing market fluctuations.\n",

      "Title: Prepaid-Powered Loyalty Programs Drive Customer Engagement for Merchants\n",
      "URL: https://www.paymentsjournal.com/prepaid-powered-loyalty-programs-drive-customer-engagement-for-merchants/\n",
      "Content: Prepaid cards are in the midst of a dramatic transformation. With the incorporation of digital wallets, contactless payments, and artificial intelligence, prepaid cards have quickly become one of the most popular payment tools. In a recent PaymentsJournal podcast, Mani Farhang, Vice President of Product at Fiserv Gift Solutions, and Jordan Hirschfield, Director of Prepaid at Javelin Strategy & Research, discussed the key innovations occurring in the prepaid space and the ways merchants can leverage them to drive customer engagement. The prepaid card market was once dominated by financial giants like Visa and Mastercard, but PayPal and Apple have emerged in the industry. And it’s no coincidence that these two companies also offer two of the leading digital wallets. “The themes in the industry are the broader shift to digital payments and increasing integration into first-party and third-party wallets,” said Farhang. “Our research indicates that 70% of consumers have downloaded a merchant app to store gift cards and fulfill loyalty rewards. This is driven by a generational shift—millennials and Gen Z are more likely to use digital gifting and take advantage of stored value in loyalty programs.” In the prepaid industry, Starbucks has been the beacon for other brands to follow due to its success with end-to-end loyalty programs. One important aspect of Starbucks’ prepaid program is how it bridges between physical and digital gift cards. For many consumers, a physical gift card is their introduction to a brand. Organizations who follow Starbucks’ lead and offer customers the means to digitize their cards into a stored-value wallet can use the initial interaction to introduce consumers to their loyalty and reward program. “That incentivization makes for a more immersive experience for the consumer, not just in gifting but in self-use,” Hirschfield said. “There is also the opportunity to engage customers beyond the value of the initial card. For merchants, they don’t want the initial prepaid card to be the only interaction—they want it to become the start of a cyclical relationship.” Merchants have an opportunity to expand their prepaid program by upgrading their payments terminals to support contactless payments. Contactless payment through near-field communication (NFC) technology has revolutionized the payments industry, and NFC has begun to gain traction in prepaid. There has also been the emergence of omnichannel, multi-purse wallets, which are first-party wallets that act as stored-value containers for multiple funding types. These wallets give consumers multiple ways to fund their stored-value wallet, whether through gift cards, pay-by-bank, debit cards, or credit. For merchants, it’s another way to engage and reward loyal customers. “Moving forward, there is the opportunity for brands to offer rebates and rewards, and even integrate third-party health and wellness programs into their digital ecosystem,” Farhang said. “The orchestration of disparate payment instruments into one ledger is advancing the integration with contactless payments.” These instruments are frequently contained in digital wallets, which are increasingly becoming the primary option for consumers, even in brick-and-mortar transactions. Businesses should have a strategy to leverage digital wallets so they can reward consumers and pre-load funds into wallets, which is a key opportunity to offer discounts and create exclusivity. Many mid-tier businesses utilize platforms that provide white-labeled apps and digital wallets that can be integrated with a merchant’s existing app, which allows them to merge loyalty points from multiple brands into a single source. Though first-party wallets are a powerful tool, third-party wallets like Apple Pay and Google Wallet should also be incorporated in an end-to-end loyalty program. “The more you engage with a customer the more you remove them from the traditional transaction process and bring them into a lifetime value scenario,” Farhang said. “Acquisition costs will decline because the brand is driving higher engagement. It can be a powerful tool for merchants because prepaid cards can increase the amount of the average order and drive repeated transactions.” Making prepaid transactions more secure is another way to increase customer satisfaction. Fraud is a hot-button issue within the prepaid space, but it’s also an area where another emerging technology—artificial intelligence—can make an impact. AI’s superior pattern recognition abilities make it an efficient tool for detecting fraudulent activities in real-time. “AI can be implemented to understand if the behaviors of purchase match the existing behaviors of the customer we have engaged with and understand,” Hirschfield said. “The less anonymous the purchases, the more those technologies can identify when purchases seem suspicious. Fraud and scams won’t ever be eliminated, but the prepaid industry can take more steps to mitigate them.” E-commerce merchants can use AI to vet both B2B and B2C accounts, because machine learning can collate signals from a range of business data and fraud detection programs in near real-time. This functionality can help merchants with decisioning and authorizations, which is often a convoluted and cumbersome process. There are also ways to implement technology that can reduce fraud at physical locations. At a retailer, a cashier might get an alert if something about a purchase looks suspicious, and they could ask the customer a series of questions to ensure the purchase is legitimate. Although fraud will always be a concern, it hasn’t slowed the rapid expansion of the prepaid market. Many businesses want to offer branded prepaid cards, but there are often barriers to entry. For this reason, third-party platforms have emerged to provide merchants with a way to get their prepaid products to market sooner. Prepaid-as-a-service has been driven by the overall shift to digital payments, but it is also extremely effective in certain use cases. In the gig economy, for instance, prepaid cards are often used as a payment instrument for freelance contractors. Many governments utilize prepaid cards to disburse payments to their citizens for various reasons. Corporations are also increasingly giving prepaid cards to their employees as incentives for loyalty or performance. “Whether it’s a retailer or a government entity, their priority is serving their customers or citizens,” Hirschfield said. “The best practice is often for them to focus on providing their products or services and implement best-in-class back-end systems to run their prepaid programs.” To achieve an optimized prepaid program, organizations will have to leverage new technologies, particularly platforms that facilitate personalization. Merchants have more customer information than ever, and AI can use that data to supercharge recommendation engines, making them more contextual and customized. Artificial intelligence is also the engine used to create the artwork and messages that drive the personalized wrapping and unwrapping experiences that have become a popular part of digital gifting. “Digital gift cards are on the rise, and digital wallets will continue to be at the core of change as more of our lives become digitized,” Farhang said. “The move to digital will continue, and there will be a convergence with the physical in a single stored ledger. The ground is shifting rapidly in the prepaid space—though gift cards are one of the most common applications for prepaid.\n",

      "URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2024/compliance-divides-stablecoin-market-why-cfos-and-treasury-teams-should-care/\n",
      "Content: Regulatory clarity sits at the center of the convergence of crypto and traditional finance. And, from the point of view of payments professionals, CFOs and treasury teams, stablecoins sit at the center of crypto’s potential within enterprise and corporate finance applications. These digital assets — designed to maintain a consistent value by pegging to fiat currencies or other assets — are increasingly being eyed for their potential to reshape key areas of corporate finance, along with cross-border payments and liquidity management. Stablecoins have surged north of a $190 billion market capitalization, jumping 46% year over year, and on Monday (Dec. 2), the blockchain-based payments solutions company Orbital announced the launch of its Stablecoin Payments Dashboard. “Stablecoins are transforming global commerce, but businesses lack clarity on how to leverage them effectively,” Orbital said in a news release. While the promise of stablecoins is immense, their adoption comes with nuanced considerations. For finance professionals, an understanding the operational benefits, regulatory landscape and strategic implications is critical for integrating stablecoins into modern treasury operations. For example, Tether, issuer of USDT — the world’s largest stablecoin — has seen its stablecoin token’s circulation rise to almost $133 billion, accounting for nearly three-quarters of the stablecoin market. But, as a result of the European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets Act (MiCA), Tether, which has faced controversy throughout its history, is pulling issuance and operational support for its euro-pegged stablecoin, EURT, in the region. Per the MiCA regulations, stablecoin issuers must hold an electronic money license in at least one EU member state in order to operate across the 27-nation bloc. Read more: Blockchain’s B2B Dreams Start With New Regulations Still, rather than pursuing EU’s MiCA compliance directly, Tether is reportedly pivoting its European strategy toward its Hadron platform, which will support MiCA-compliant stablecoins issued by other entities. This move marks a departure from the approach taken by competitors like Circle, the issuer of USDC, which has embraced regulatory compliance in jurisdictions like the EU. Circle’s integration with banks and financial institutions has positioned it as a comparatively compliant choice for enterprises requiring stable, regulated digital assets. Crypto exchange Coinbase, which until 2023 managed the USDC stablecoin alongside Circle, in October moved to delist Tether from the platform it offers European Economic Area users. As regulatory frameworks solidify in major jurisdictions, the moves of issuers like Tether are highlighting an emerging potential divide within the sector — one that could reshape the stablecoin landscape into two distinct tiers. Stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT, while widely used, have faced persistent questions about transparency and regulatory compliance. By focusing on platforms like Hadron, Tether may be positioning itself to serve a different market — one less reliant on stringent oversight and more aligned with the ethos of decentralized finance. This bifurcation could create a fragmented market, with each tier catering to distinct user bases and applications. Fully regulated stablecoins may dominate institutional use cases, while less-regulated alternatives could thrive in peer-to-peer transfers, emerging markets and DeFi ecosystems. At least one financial institution, however, is interested in partnering up with Tether. Cantor Fitzgerald is reportedly seeking support for its planned $2 billion bitcoin lending project from Tether. Read more: Why Banks Might Want to Have a Blockchain Strategy Stablecoins are no longer confined to crypto trading pairs or speculative activity. Companies like Stripe and PayPal have also gotten into the stablecoin business. Part of the appeal for enterprises lies in the ability of stablecoins to facilitate near-instant transactions, help to reduce costs and provide transparency. For multinational businesses, traditional cross-border transactions can take days to settle, burdening businesses with delays and high fees. Stablecoins, leveraging blockchain technology, can enable near-real-time settlements, reducing costs and freeing up working capital. “Blockchain solutions and stablecoins — I don’t like to use the term crypto because this is more about FinTech — they’ve found product-market fit in cross-border payments,” Sheraz Shere, general manager of payments and commerce at Solana Foundation, told PYMNTS in September. “You get the disintermediation, you get the speed, you get the transparency, you get extremely low cost.” PYMNTS Intelligence found that using cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments could be the winning use case that the sector has been looking for. The research found that blockchain-based cross-border solutions, particularly stablecoins, are being increasingly embraced by firms looking to find a better way to transact and expand internationally. As it relates to liquidity management, finance professionals can often face challenges with managing cash reserves across multiple jurisdictions. Stablecoins can help provide a seamless mechanism for reallocating funds globally, particularly in regions with limited banking infrastructure. PYMNTS covered on Nov. 25 how cryptocurrencies, and more specifically their underlying blockchain technologies, have gone from a solution in search of a problem to a solution in hopes of some regulatory clarity. Of course, that clarity may come when cryptocurrency companies and other firms embrace and invest in, rather than resist, appropriate guardrails for their industries. Still, with the news Monday (Dec. 2) that the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) reportedly aims to prevent centralized exchanges from allowing their users to withdraw stablecoins to self-custodial wallets, it’s worth reiterating that a lot of the economics behind stablecoins and their monetization comes from interest income and is predicated on users holding, not using, their stablecoins.\n",

      "URL: https://www.pymnts.com/amazon/2024/amazon-reports-record-sales-during-black-friday-week-and-cyber-monday/\n",
      "Content: Amazon saw record sales and a record number of items sold during its Black Friday Week and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event. The company’s event ran from Nov. 21 through Monday (Dec. 2) and was bigger than any previous 12-day period ending on Cyber Monday, Amazon said in a Tuesday (Dec. 3) press release. The shopping event was also the largest ever for independent sellers in Amazon’s store, with these sellers accounting for more than 60% of sales during this 12-day period, according to the release. The event’s best-selling products included Amazon’s Echo and Fire TV devices, and the best-selling product categories in the U.S. included electronics, toys and beauty, per the release. “We know how much our customers appreciate saving money, and our customers saved billions with us during this year’s holiday shopping event,” Doug Herrington, CEO, Worldwide Amazon Stores, said in the release. “And we have many more fun and exciting ways for them to continue to save this holiday season.” This news from Amazon follows some other reports of higher sales during this year’s Black Friday. Adobe Analytics data showed that Black Friday shoppers spent a record $10.8 billion this year, a figure that was 10% higher than last year’s total and double the amount spent in 2017, NPR reported Sunday (Dec. 1). “Crossing the $10 billion mark is a big eCommerce milestone for Black Friday, for a day that in the past was more anchored towards in-store shopping,” Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst with Adobe Digital Insights, said in the report. Mastercard SpendingPulse data said that this year’s Black Friday saw a 14.6% increase in online retail sales and a 0.7% increase in in-store sales. This report found that jewelry, electronics and apparel remained the top holiday gift sectors. “Over the last several years, Black Friday has become more than just one day, but instead a window of time for shoppers to find value,” Mastercard said in a press release. “While consumers were enticed by early deals in the days leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, Black Friday continued to reign as one of the biggest days of the season.”\n",
